# Simon Game

## Overview

The Simon Game is a memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors that the game shows. Each turn, the game adds a new color to the sequence. The goal is to repeat the sequence accurately to advance to the next round.

## Technologies Used

## How to Play

1. The game will start by flashing a sequence of colors.
2. Memorize the sequence and then click the colors in the same order.
3. If you get the sequence correct, the game will add a new color to the sequence.
4. If you make a mistake, the game will show an error and restart.
